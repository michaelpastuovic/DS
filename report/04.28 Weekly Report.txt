Progress


* In our weekly out-of-class team meeting, we reviewed previous work to ensure each group member was on the same page
* Squared on analysis of visualizations created, spoke about how they may guide our future efforts
* Began preliminary tuning of machine learning tools including Adaboost, Random Forest, ensemble modeling


Issues
* Vast number of variables so running our models does take significant time
* Some difficulty having an intuitive understanding of what the model is doing/saying given the extremely large data set


Future Plans
* Create realistic goals regarding the overall strength of our modeling process while continuing to look for the potential to improve
* This week we will undertake creating a PowerPoint deck for the upcoming presentation and prepare our statements


Overall, we are happy with the progress we are making to this point and are looking forward to staying on track this coming week.
